Simple example of how to use Psychtoolbox to play sound on the RME Fireface UC sound card. 

Check out [Psychtoolbox documentation](http://psychtoolbox.org). 

Check out [RME documentation and drivers](https://www.rme-audio.de/fireface-uc.html). There is also very nice [playlist of short tutorial videos about TotalMix](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0QKeSpeDQwHGxAhD-cJSIBZC7_en5rck). 

You can also find the documentation for trigger box and old tapping box in the Dropbox shared folder (note this will migrate to OneDrive soon). 

If you want to test stuff, we have a spare card in the RnB storage locker.
